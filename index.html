            <p>This is our Senior Capstone Project at UCSD. We are looking into 
                the spread of misinformation on social media platforms.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3 id="target_intro" class="head">Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Last quarter's project involved downloading twitter data 
                    based on pre downloaded tweet IDs related to COVID-19. 
                    We peeled back the layers of a misinformation network using 
                    k-core analysis in addition to performing exploratory data
                    analysis. While this project yielded interesting findings, 
                    it seemed limited to COVID-19-related misinformation only, 
                    and finding similar pre-categorized twitter data such as 
                    this can be very difficult. As a result, we decided to 
                    continue our investigation of misinformation in social media 
                    on Reddit's platform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We decided to base this project off of Reddit data because 
                    Reddit offers pre-categorized information by virtue of having
                    many Subreddit communities, which are, generally, 
                    communities leaning towards a specific topic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similar projects such as ours have been done in the past. 
                    For example, a paper title, "The Web Centipede: Understanding 
                    How Web Communities Influence Each Other Through the Lens of 
                    Mainstream and Alternative News Sources" , written by  
                    Nicolas Kourtelris, Ilias Leontiadis, Michael Sirivianos, 
                    Gianluca Stringhini, and Jeremy Blackburn, also looks into 
                    the spread of misinformation on the Reddit Platform. The 
                    paper compares the spread of mainstream and alternative news
                    URLs on Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan, and it finds that 4chan 
                    and six selected Subreddits have a very high percentage of 
                    alternative news URLs compared to other communities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our study will also involve identifying the frequency of 
                    misinformation on selected Subreddits based off of the 
                    presence of misinformation URLs. Our data will primarily 
                    consist of Reddit submissions and their respective 
                    attributes such as whether there is misinformation, 
                    subreddit name, the author, upvotes, downvotes etc. This 
                    will allow us to gauge the presence of misinformation on 
                    Subreddits individually and analyze the relationships 
                    between Subreddits based on their shared users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to identify URLs as misinformation or not, we will 
                    use a third party list of misinformation domains made 
                    publicly available by iffy.news.
                </p>

            <h3 id="target_research" class="head">Research Question</h3>
                <p>
                    How does the spread of misinformation vary from subreddit to
                     subreddit, and what is the relationship between these 
                     subreddits?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What can user activity tell us about trends within 
                        subreddits and users who commonly post misinformation?
                    </li> 
                </ul>

            <h3 id="target_hypothesis" class="head">Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    Subreddits leaning more towards sensitive topics, such as 
                    politics, news etc. are more likely to be spreading 
                    misinformation. In addition, these subreddits may share a 
                    lot of the same users. 
                </p>

            <h3 id="target_methods" class="head">Methods</h3>
                
                <p>
                    System specifications used for our scripts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At least 2 gigabytes of RAM</li> 
                    <li>Stable Internet</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    First, data will be acquired using the Python Reddit API 
                    Wrapper, PRAW, which provides access to public data made 
                    available by Reddit and simply requires creating an account 
                    and an associated application. Getting data in this case 
                    involves two steps: Downloading the data and uploading the 
                    data to Google Sheets.
                </p>

                <h4 class="head">Choosing the subreddits </h4>
                    <p>
                        We decided to choose subreddits in a way that provides 
                        us with a holistic view of the spread of misinformation.
                        We identified 5 primary different types of subreddits to analyze:
                        Top 5 most popular, Highest raw growth in the last year, 
                        Political, Covid related, and News. This way we have a 
                        diverse group of subreddits to see where a 
                        disproportionate amount of misinformation is compared to
                        others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, there is a dynamic topic callled "Expanded MisInfo Network Subreddits",
                        where we can programmatically add new subreddits based off of analysis of users who
                        are known to post misinformation. So if a subreddit is seen as popular among the misinfo-posters
                        we analyze, we can add that subreddit to our list for future analysis. 
                    </p>
                <h4 class="head">Downloading the data</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to download the data, we simply download the 
                        last 800-1000 submissions sorted by the upvote count per 
                        Subreddit. We store the submission data as entries in 
                        memory, and then upload it into a google sheet using 
                        Python's gspread package.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While the data is in memory, we analyze the URLs for 
                        every submission. If there is a URL, it will be 
                        identified as misinformation based on whether its domain
                         name is in our list of misinformation domains. If the 
                         URL is identified as misinformation, it will be flagged
                          as so.
                    </p>

                <h4 class="head">Uploading the Data</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once the data is all saved in a dataframe, itâ€™ll be 
                        uploaded to a google sheet using the gspread package. 
                        This is done as a bulk upload, so it is fast and 
                        efficient.
                    </p>


            <h3 id="target_analysis" class="head">Analysis & Results</h3>
                <h4 class="head">Exploratory Data Analysis</h4>
                    <p>
                        The question we wanted to address is â€œHow does the 
                        spread of misinformation vary from subreddit to 
                        subreddit, and what is the relationship between these 
                        subreddits?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We first identified all of the posts with misinformation
                        URLs and created a separate dataframe. Afterwards, we 
                        created a bar chart that showed the count of 
                        misinformation posts based on each individual 
                        subreddit, giving us a good overview on the prevalence
                        of misinformation in each community.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Based on the misinformation submissions we have, we 
                        identify the users and rank them based on how much 
                        misinformation they individually post. This way, we can 
                        identify the most prolific users in regards to the 
                        spread of misinformation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, we find the subreddits these users are most active
                        in. This is done by analyzing their comments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the subreddits that share the most users who 
                        have posted high amounts of misinformation are shown 
                        in our <a href="analysis.html">results page</a>.
                    </p>
            
            <h3 class="head">Discussion & Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>
                    We began this study asking how the spread of 
                    misinformation may vary from subreddit to subreddit and 
                    what the relationship between these subreddits may 
                    entail. We found that subreddits tend to be 
                    ideologically homogeneous despite the proportion of 
                    misinformation submissions. Also, we found that certain 
                    subreddits seem to play a larger role in the 
                    misinformation network than others, i.e. "Conservative",
                    "Conservatives", "walkaway". We found that the top 
                    misinformation domains shared among the subreddits we 
                    analyzed are "breitbart", "americanthinker", and 
                    "flagandcross". Lastly, our hypothesis was confirmed to 
                    be correct when we found that political and news-related
                    subreddits had a higher proportion of misinformation 
                    submissions than other subreddit categories. While our 
                    study is limited by the small sample
                    size of submissions we analyze from each subreddit, our 
                    analysis seems to provide a thorough outlook on the 
                    misinformation network on Reddit because we analyze 
                    subreddits of different categories and expand our view 
                    of the misinformation network through utilizing 
                    user-comment activity.
